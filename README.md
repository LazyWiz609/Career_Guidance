# **Career Guidance System**
A machine learning-based career recommendation system using the KARRIEREWEGE dataset.

# **Project Description**
This Career Guidance System is a prototype developed for Execute 4.0. It uses a Random Forest classifier trained on the KARRIEREWEGE dataset to provide career recommendations based on user inputs such as experience level and preferred job titles.

# **Setup Instructions**
  **Clone the repository:**
  - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Career-Guidance-System.git`
  - `cd Career-Guidance-System`

  **Install required libraries:**
- `pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit joblib`
  
**Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:**
  - preprocessed_data.csv
  - trained_model.joblib
  - app.py
  
## **How to Run**
Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
- `streamlit run app.py`

# **Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning (Random Forest classifier)
Streamlit: Web application framework
Joblib: Model serialization

# **Future Improvements**
1. Expand the dataset to include more career paths and skills.
2. Include more questions for the final product to predict more accurately and specific to each user.
3. Implement more advanced machine learning models for better predictions.
4. Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements.
5. Integrate real-time job market data for more relevant recommendations.
6. Add multilingual support for a wider user base.
7. Implement user accounts for saving and tracking career recommendations over time.
